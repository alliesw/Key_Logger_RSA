how to generate RSA private & public key pairs using OpenSSL 

(i) generate private:
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
cat private_key.pem

(ii) public
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public_key.pem
cat public_key.pem
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

> create text file called "secret.txt"
echo 'This is a secret message, for authorized parties only' > secret.txt
------------------------------------------------------------
. Encrypt and decrypt
> encyrpt w/ public key: 
openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey public_key.pem -in secret.txt -out secret.enc
nano ~/secret.enc
>decrypt w/ private 
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private_key.pem -in secret.enc

--------------------------------------
. Verify using the key pair to sign and verify data
>create a hash digest of the message 
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private_key.pem -out secret.txt.sha256 secret.txt
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify public_key.pem -signature secret.txt.sha256 secret.txt 

Hashing & Hash Verification
----------------------------
>Create a Text File
echo 'This is some text in a file, just so we have some data' > file.txt

>md5sum  
md5sum file.txt > file.txt.md5
cat file.txt.md5

>md5 verify hash 
md5sum -c file.txt.md5

>md5sum failure: verify an invalid file
cp file.txt badfile.txt
md5sum badfile.txt > badfile.txt.md5
cat badfile.txt.md5
cat file.txt.md5

> Modify using Nano text editor (add space to end via arrow) 
nano badfile.txt
ctrl+X 
Y
> verify hash of modified file 
md5sum -c badfile.txt.md5

>Recompute MD5 Sum 
> inspect by generating new md5sum of edited file 
md5sum badfile.txt > new.badfile.txt.md5
cat new.badfile.txt.md5

compute SHA1 Hash:
shasum file.txt > file.txt.sha1
inspect:
cat file.txt.sha1
verify: 
shasum -c file.txt.sha1

compute SHA256 Hash:
shasum -a 256 file.txt > file.txt.sha256
inspect: 
cat file.txt.sha256
verify:
shasum -c file.txt.sha256

security infrastructure design document 
for a small retail organization - a widgets retailer, with 50 employees in one small office 
that handles critical customer payment data 

Needs:
- An external website permitting users to browse and purchase widgets
- An internal intranet website for employees to use
- Secure remote access for engineering employees
- Reasonable, basic firewall rules
- Wireless coverage in the office
- Reasonably secure configurations for laptops

Authentication system
(1) Kerberos-time-based Token-based MFA Authentication 
(2) biometric-based password via facial recognition and fingerprints
(3) MFA - users must present 2 or more forms of identification to login to an account
(4) text-based passwords must contain more than 8 chars and must be updated every 6months

External website security
The external website must permit users to browse and purchase widgets
(1) Website should use HTTPS protocol in combination with an SSL certificate 
(2) Constantly update software, plugins, etc., to fix bugs/glitches 


Internal website security
internal intranet website for employees to use
(1) Constantly update passwords   
(2) Limit user access using least priviledge authorization 
(3) Token-based MFA authentication   

Remote access solution 
Since the company must allow all of their engineering employees to remotely work, 
a cybersecurity policy for those remote workers must be established, that provides guidelines
for complying with security protocols at home or travel. 
(1) All engineering employees will be provided with Company-owned Devices

Firewall and basic rules recommendations
(1) Configure network traffic filtering in firewall's inbound rules to block incoming requests from unknown sources
(2) Configure an ACL 
(3) Create a Unfified Threat Management (UTM) technology 
by implementing a firewall with IPS integration   

Wireless security
(1) install antivirus and anti-malware
(2) update software
(3) Patch vulnerabilities 
(4) Use Encryption (AES) to secure company data 

VLAN configuration recommendations
Remote workers will use a remote access SSL VPN client to connect to 
the organization's VPN gateway - to gain access to it's internal network 

Laptop security configuration
(1) Configure firewall settings 
(2) Install antivirus and anti-malware 
(3) Configure auto password change every 6months 

Application policy recommendations
- block inappropriate applications
- All Users - Run Normally for Approved Apps 
- IT Admins - Elevate Rights/Trust - Approved Apps 
- All Users - Restrict access to time of day  


Security and privacy policy recommendations
- Employee cybersecurity training and awareness 
(1) Provide clearly documented procedures for responding to cyber threats
	(a) Train employees to stop opening email attachments from unknown senders by conducting phishing exercises
	(b) Train employees how to create strong passwords (>8 chars) 
	(c) Train employees to reocongize and respond to various cybersecurity attacks

Intrusion detection or prevention 
The company will use an IPS to provide network security and threat prevention for their systems containing customer data.
The IPS will analyze network traffic flows to both detect and prevent vulnerability exploits
of customer data.
